Local testing
-------------

You can test this extension from the docs folder:

   pip install sphinx-autobuild

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and start searching!

.. note::

   The extension works when is hosted on Read the Docs,
   but to make it work locally a custom ``READTHEDOCS_DATA`` js variable is injected automatically
   to send the search requests to https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/search/.
